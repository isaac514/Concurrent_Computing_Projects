1. Are there any race conditions in this prefix sum computation? Why?

    1a) No there are no race condition because the threads are ran sequentially and the arrB
    is updated appropriately based on the preifx sum algorithm.

2. Can the result of x[i]+x[i-2 h-1 ] of run h be saved back to x[i]? Explain your findings as clearly as possible.

    2a) Yes this result could be stored back to the input array x, however this result also will need to be stored back to arrB[i,j] so that the algorithm works properly.

3. The main() creates n threads in each iteration and waits for them to complete. There is a
significant amount of time in creating and joining threads. If you are allowed to use extra
variables/arrays and busy waiting, can you just create n threads and let them do all the work without the use of a temporary array B[*,*]? Suggest a solution and discuss its correctness.

    3a) A solution is likely possible where the array B is not used. However this would require synchronization such that the thread relying on another computation have to wait until that computation completes.
